(1) Install the Node.js JavaScript runtime environment using your OS package manager.

    (On Ubuntu 18.04, just do 'apt-get install nodejs' as 'root', otherwise go to:
     https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)


(2) Verify that Node.js has been installed:

    $ node -v

    v8.10.0


(3) Install the NPM Node Package Manager.

    (On Ubuntu 18.04, just do 'apt-get install npm' as 'root', otherwise go to:
     https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node#installing-npm-from-the-nodejs-site)


(4) Verify that NPM has been installed:

    $ npm -v

    3.5.2


(5) Install the latest version 4 of the Webpack module bundler:

    $ npm install webpack@^4.12.1

    ...


(6) Install the NPM package 'webpack-cli':

    $ npm install webpack-cli

    ...


(7) Bundle the JavaScript with Webpack for deployment:

    $ ./node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js --config ./webpack.config.js

    ...


(8) If you want Webpack to auto-re-bundle your JavaScript whenever any of it changes, issue this
    command instead:

    $ ./node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js --config ./webpack.config.js --watch

    ...
